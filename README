The IPL Team Analytics Management System is a Python-based mini project created to get a simplified representation of the performance analysis of different IPL cricket teams over the course of the competitionâ€™s history from 2008 to 2022. The IPL Board of Management, team captains, coaches, players, and key spectators can use this system to analyze and effectively manage their respective team's current accomplishments in league games and play-offs for the upcoming seasons in the future and they can implement new strategies for their improvement with support of this system.
